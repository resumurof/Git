                That’s why when you are trying to attach the same process from Internet Explorer Developer toolbar, it is throwing an error "Unable to attach the process. Another debugger might be attached to the process" .

So now we know what was causing the issue and let’s have a look at what we did to resolve this.

As a resolution, we used "Detach All" from debug menu, which actually detached all the processes which are attached with Visual Studio except local ASP.NET Development server process (WebDev.WebServer40.EXE).

Note: "Detach All" will detach all the attached process apart from ASP.NET Development server. Because detaching the development server is nothing but stopping your application. If you want to stop, either stop debugging or "Terminate" the local development sever process.

"Detach All" will remove iexplore.exe from the list of attached process. So, you can go ahead and start the debugging in Internet Explorer Developer toolbar.
